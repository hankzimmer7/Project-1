# Project-1

Branch3 is Brett's first. It will contain some weather API functionality, based on Activity 06-Ajax 05-Bujumbara.

There are questions over what to take in and what to return.
Since openweathermap returns up to a 5-day forecast, we can start by a location input, and a weather object output.

Brett wants to learn why 'branch3' doesn't have either the index.html or the assets folder. The branch was probably created _BEFORE_ the master received its first few files.

For clean, sharable code, I will try my first version using two files - one with all the console logging, for discussion, and one that's more readable.
